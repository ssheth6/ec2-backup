EC2-BACKUP(1)             General Commands Manual                EC2-BACKUP(1)

NAME
     ec2-backup -- backup a directory into Elastic Block Storage (EBS)

SYNOPSIS
     ec2-backup [-h] [-m method] [-v volume-id] dir

DESCRIPTION
     The ec2-backup tool performs a backup of the given directory into Amazon
     Elastic Block Storage (EBS).  This is achieved by creating a volume of
     the appropriate size, attaching it to an EC2 instance and finally copying
     the files from the given directory into this volume.

OPTIONS
     ec2-backup accepts the following command-line flags:

     -h            Print a usage statement and exit.

     -m method     Use the given method to perform the backup.  Valid methods
                   are 'dd' and 'rsync'; default is 'dd'.

     -v volume-id  Use the given volume instead of creating a new one.

DETAILS
     ec2-backup will perform a backup of the given directory to an ESB volume.
     The backup is done in one of two ways: via direct write to the volume as
     a block device (utilizing tar(1) on the local host and dd(1) on the
     remote instance), or via a (possibly incremental) filesystem sync (uti-
     lizing rsync(1)).

     Unless the -v flag is specified, ec2-backup will create a new volume, the
     size of which will be at least two times the size of the directory to be
     backed up.

     ec2-backup will create an instance suitable to perform the backup, attach
     the volume in question and then back up the data from the given directory
     using the specified method and then shut down and terminate the instanceOUTPUT
     By default, ec2-backup prints the volume ID of the volume to which it
     backed up the data as the only output.  If the EC2_BACKUP_VERBOSE envi-
     ronment variable is set, it may also print out some useful information
     about what steps it is currently performing.

     Any errors encountered cause a meaningful error message to be printed out

ENVIRONMENT
     ec2-backup assumes that the user has set up their environment for general
     use with the EC2 tools.  That is, it will not set or modify any environ-
     ment variables.

     ec2-backup allows the user to add custom flags to the commands related to
     starting a new EC2 instance via the EC2_BACKUP_FLAGS_AWS environment
     variable.

     ec2-backup also assumes that the user has set up their ~/.ssh/config file
     to access instances in EC2 via ssh(1) without any additional settings.
     It does allow the user to add custom flags to the ssh(1) commands it
     invokes via the EC2_BACKUP_FLAGS_SSH environment variable.

     As noted above, the EC2_BACKUP_VERBOSE variable may cause ec2-backup to
     generate informational output as it runs.

EXIT STATUS
     The ec2-backup will exit with a return status of 0 under normal circum-
     stances.  If an error occurred, ec2-backup will exit with a value >0.

EXAMPLES
     The following examples illustrate common usage of this tool.

     To back up the entire filesystem using rsync(1):

           $ ec2-backup -m rsync /
           vol-a1b2c3d4
      To create a complete backup of the current working directory using
       defaults (and thus not requiring a filesystem to exist on the volume) to
     the volume with the ID vol-1a2b3c4d:

           ec2-backup -v vol-1a2b3c4d .

     Suppose a user has their ~/.ssh/config set up to use the private key
     ~/.ec2/stevens but wishes to use the key ~/.ssh/ec2-key instead:Consideration
        here is the ec2-key is the keyname


           $ export EC2_BACKUP_FLAGS_SSH="-i ~/.ssh/ec2-key"
           $ ec2-backup .
           vol-a1b2c3d4
           $

     To force creation of an instance type of t1.micro instead of whatever
     defaults might apply

           $ export EC2_BACKUP_FLAGS_AWS="--instance-type t1.micro"
           $ ec2-backup .
           vol-a1b2c3d4
           $
           
HISTORY
        This tool has been written in BASH language. It offers functional improvements over sh for both programming and interactive use;
        these include command line editing, unlimited size command history, job control, shell functions and aliases, indexed arrays of unlimited size,
        and integer arithmetic in any base from two to sixty-four. Bash can run most sh scripts without modification.

APPROACH
        We listed out the features that the tool could support.
        Features:
                # User can run this tool by only specifying the directory and the rest will be taken care of by the tool for the user
                # User has the option of specifying the method to perform the backup. Valid methods are 'dd' and 'rsync'; default is 'dd'.
                # User has the option to forcing the tool to use the specified volume-id instead of creating one
                # Tool supports the following combinations:
                        a)  -m dd/rsync -v <Available Volume-id> path-to-directory/file
                        b)  -v <Available Volume-id> path-to-directory/file
                        c)  -m dd/rsync path-to-directory/file
                        d)   path-to-directory/file or (.) the current working directory
                # User can force the instance-type to t1.micro instead of the default t2.micro
                # User can provide the key he wishes to choose or let the tool create a new one
                # After the backup. The tool terminates the instance created for the backup
                # Incase the user wishes to abort the execution of the tool. On the key-press of Ctrl+C the tool would gracefully terminate the background
                  running instance created for the backup
        Created the skeleton plan to support these features
        Created a repository on GitHub. Divided the functionality amongst the team members. A branch was created for every feature supported.
        Once the feature was tested and ready to deployed, a peer review request was created for the team and thereafter merged to the master branch on GitHub.
        This approach helped in synchronizing the work distributed.

CONSIDERATIONS:
        1) If a flag is set the user will mention the parameter
        2) If EC2_BACKUP_FLAGS_SSH environment variable is set then the key mentioned in the path is the keyname
        3) The user will provide instance type t1.micro
